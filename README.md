## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1. 🤖 [LangGraph-powered Agentic RAG](https://github.com/indrakumar94/rag-langgraph-agenticai)
> Chatbot with memory + vector search + LangGraph orchestration
- 📄 Handles large PDF ingestion (~1000 pages)
- 🧠 Uses Azure OpenAI + ChromaDB + Redis for memory
- 🔁 Multi-user, async architecture

### 2. 📊 [Multi Agent Orchestration with Supervisor/Worker Agent System](https://github.com/indrakumar94/multiagent_orchestration_langgraph)
> LangGraph-powered multi agent orchestration where a supervisor agent assigns tasks to worker agents
- 🧹 FastAPI + LangGraph
- 🔁 Supervisor handoff with task description to workers
- 📈 Used Tavily Search and created custom task specific tools
  
### 3. 📦 [Product Copywriting with LLMs](https://github.com/your-username/product-copywriter-llm)
> Batch generation of product titles using Flan-T5 with FastAPI and SageMaker pipeline
- 🔁 Batch inference via SageMaker batch transform
- 🧪 MLflow logging + evaluation metrics (ROUGE)
- ☁️ Deployed on: `AWS SageMaker` + `FastAPI` + `Docker`

### 4. 📊 [MLOps Pipeline for Demand Forecasting](https://github.com/your-username/demand-forecasting-pipeline)
> End-to-end MLOps pipeline using Azure ML SDK
